## Network Installation

<br />

**Important:** Before installing, make sure bungeecord is set to true in EVERY spigot.yml

<br />

Firstly install the *InsaneAnnouncer.jar* on every Server including your BungeeCord.
In the next step, you have to enable MySQL for every Server via the intuitive interface.

<br />

* Execute **/announcer**, navigate to *Settings > MySQL* and enter your MySQL credentials
* Restart your Server

After you have repeated that process for every Server, Insane Announcer should now be fully functional!

<br />

In the event that you create a new Server, just repeat the steps. The BungeeCord is configuring itself fully automatically
